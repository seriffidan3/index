      <h2>Week 1 – The Debut</h2>
      <div class="date">May 19, 2025</div>
      <p>
        CGW launched its first-ever broadcast with a bang. The show opened with the coronation of the inaugural World Heavyweight Champion, Johnny Rogue, but the celebration was cut short by the unexpected arrival of The New Order — a chaotic faction led by an unseen mastermind.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the main event, Rogue was confronted by Oblivion, leading to a brutal no-contest brawl that spilled out of the ring and into the arena halls. Meanwhile, Ade made a stunning debut win against Trevor, and the tag team division got its first taste of gold fever as Bryan Zap & Resin Rick teased an alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backstage tensions rose as The Overlooked demanded respect, and the seeds of power struggles began to bloom across CGW. Pulse has arrived — and it’s already out for blood.
